Hi Transformers! This repository is meant for us to practice our git skills before we develop our app. If youre comfortable doing so, please do the following tasks:

Task 1:

Please pull this remote repository and add a text file with your name in it on your own local repository. Then, commit and push your changes into the remote repository on the develop branch!

Task 2:

Create a pull request to merge changes to the master branch. 

Task 3: 

Review, comment, and approve pull requests to merge branches!

Task 4: 

Modify a text file your team member created. For instance, you can add your name in the text file they have created. After doing so, commit and push your changes on the develop branch. Ask for another pull request.

Task 5: 

Create a new branch and make more changes using this branch. Note: For our development Sprints, each team member must use their own branch to avoid confusion and errors.
