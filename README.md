Hi Transformers! This repository is meant for us to practice our git skills before we develop our app. If youre comfortable doing so, please do the following tasks:

Task 1:

Please pull this remote repository and add a text file with your name in it on your own local repository. Then, commit and push your changes into the remote repository on the develop branch! (If someone already committed on the develop branch, use develop2 branch)

Task 2:

Create a pull request for approval. If approved by other team member, merge changes to the master branch. (Next time, we will change the git repository settings so that you cannot merge into the master branch without having atleast 1 team member approving the pull request)

Task 3: 

Review, comment, approve, and merge pull requests to merge branches!

Task 4: 

Modify a text file your team member created. For instance, you can add your name in the text file they have created. After doing so, commit and push your changes on the develop branch. Ask for another pull request.

Task 5: 

Create a new branch and make more changes using this branch. Note: For our development sprints, each team member must use their own branch to avoid confusion and commit errors.
