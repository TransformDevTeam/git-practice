Hi Transformers! This repository is meant for us to practice our git skills before we develop our app. If youre comfortable doing so, please do the following tasks:

Task 1:

Please clone this remote repository and add a text file with your name on it on your own local repository. Then, commit and push your changes into the remote repository on the develop branch! (If someone already committed on the develop branch, use develop2 branch)

Task 2:

Create a pull request for approval. If approved by other team member, merge changes to the master branch. (Next time, we will change the git repository settings so that you cannot merge into the master branch without having atleast 1 team member approving the pull request, same with the develop branch)

Task 3: 

Review, comment, approve, and merge pull requests to merge branches to master!

Task 4: 

Modify a text file your team member created. For instance, you can add your name in the text file they have created. After doing so, commit and push your changes on the develop/develop2 branch. Ask for another pull request to merge to the master branch.

Task 5: 

Create a new branch and make more changes using this branch. 

Note: For our development sprints, each team member must use their own branch to avoid bugs and commit errors. Team members should not work or push directly to the develop and master branch. Instead, each team member can commit on their own branch and process a pull request to merge on the develop branch from your own branch. Then, once the version on the develop branch have been tested and it works, then we can approve the develop branch to be merged into the master branch.

Reminder: Please don't forget to pull from the master branch in order to get the latest version of the code! Thanks :)
